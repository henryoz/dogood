# dogood
A simple app to help people find ways to help their communities

## Mission
*dogood* is intended to work as an easy entry point for civic-minded people who have the time and/or resources to contribute to their local communites but lack the knowledge to get started.
The site is divided into regions, each containing a range of links for local organistions, grouped by easy to parse categories, in need of money / volunteers to help with their causes.

##Contribute
You can add to *dogood* by submitting a pull request containing a new `{cityname}.js` file within the `client/cities` directory. We'll take care of the rest <3

##Run / Build
If you want to fork this repo and play around, simply download the code and run npm install from the root directory. Then use npm run dev to build & serve up a development version or npm run build to build a production version. However, be aware that Dogood is currently very much a work in progress and is prone to major changes in the forseeable future.
